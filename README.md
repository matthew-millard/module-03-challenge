## My Process

1. I refactored the existing starter code so it was fully responsive to different viewport sizes.
2. Applied my own styling to make the app stand out.
3. I wrote pseudo code so I had a road map to programming the app in JavaScript.
4. Once I was satisfied with my script, I spent a great deal of time testing for bugs.
5. Deployed the app on Github pages.
